      "\n",
      "## Issue Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The production API server became unreachable due to a full root filesystem. SSH login was slow, and application containers were repeatedly restarting. Investigation revealed that the root partition utilization reached 100%, which prevented services from writing logs and temporary files.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "\n",
      "Production monitoring alerted us about an issue with disk usage at 100% on the production API server's root partition. SSH access to the server became slow, and application containers started restarting frequently. This caused significant downtime for critical services relying on this API server.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon further investigation, we found that a substantial amount of data was stored in log files and temporary directories, leading to the filesystem exhaustion.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The root cause of the issue can be attributed to two main factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Uncontrolled Growth of Application Log Files**: The application logs were not rotated automatically due to missing configuration, causing them to consume a significant amount of disk space.\n",
      "2. **Absence of Automated Log Rotation Mechanism**: Without proper log rotation settings, files grew unchecked over time until they took up almost 100% of the root filesystem.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Troubleshooting & Resolution Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step-by-Step Resolution:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify and Delete Large Files:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- SSH into the production API server.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Run `du -a | sort -n -r | head` to find large directories using excessive space.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Identify and delete unnecessary logs or cache files manually or via scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Configure Log Rotation for Daily Files:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Use the `logrotate` utility to configure daily log rotation with appropriate retention policies. For example:\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     /etc/logrotate.d/myapp {\n",
      "         weekly\n",
      "         rotate 5\n",
      "         maxage 30\n",
      "         compress\n",
      "         missingok\n",
      "         notifempty\n",
      "         create 644 root adm\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Ensure that log files are rotated daily to prevent them from growing out of control.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increase Root Disk Volume:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Contact the storage team to request an increase in the root disk volume.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Monitor disk usage closely for a week after the upgrade to ensure the new space is being used efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Set Disk Usage Alerts:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Configure alerts that notify the DevOps Team when the filesystem reaches 80% and 90%. This will allow timely intervention before the issue escalates.\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     df -h | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' > /tmp/disk_usage.txt && while read usage; do if [ \"$usage\" == \"100%\" ]; then echo \"$(date) \n",
      "- Root filesystem is 100% full. Alerting team...\" ; fi; done < /tmp/disk_usage.txt\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example of a Bash Script for Automated Disk Usage Monitoring:\n",
      "\n",
      "```sh\n",
      "#!/bin/bash\n",
      "\n",
      "# Function to log disk usage alerts\n",
      "log_alert() {\n",
      "    echo \"$(date) \n",
      "- Root filesystem is $1%. Alerting team...\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "# Check current root disk utilization\n",
      "current_usage=$(df / | awk 'NR==2 {print $5}' | cut -d'%' -f1)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Log the alert if the usage exceeds 90%\n",
      "if [ \"$current_usage\" -ge \"90\" ]; then\n",
      "    log_alert 90\n",
      "fi\n",
      "\n",
      "# Log the alert if the usage exceeds 80%\n",
      "if [ \"$current_usage\" -ge \"80\" ]; then\n",
      "    log_alert 80\n",
      "fi\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Save this script as `/usr/local/bin/check_root_disk.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/check_root_disk.sh`, and run it periodically.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Restart Services for Immediate Effect:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- After making changes, restart any affected services to apply the new log rotation settings and disk usage alerts.\n",
      "     ```sh\n",
      "     systemctl restart <service_name>\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Monitor System Health:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Continuously monitor disk usage and application performance after implementing the resolution steps. Ensure that logs are rotated regularly and file sizes do not exceed safe limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Preventive Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implement Automated Log Rotation:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Regularly review and update log rotation configurations to ensure they follow best practices.\n",
      "2. **Set Up Disk Usage Monitoring Alerts:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Utilize tools like `logrotate` for automatic file management and set up alerts with appropriate thresholds.\n",
      "3. **Maintain a Healthy Software Stack:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Keep all software dependencies, including libraries and frameworks, updated to prevent uncontrolled growth of files.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can effectively resolve the issue and ensure that your production API server remains accessible and performant in the future.\n",

      "The staging environment was inaccessible due to a \"No space left on device\" error in the /var directory, resulting in failed CI deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "\n",
      "A failure occurred in the CI/CD pipeline where attempts to deploy new versions of applications into the staging environment were unsuccessful. The issue stemmed from reaching the disk capacity threshold within the /var directory, which is a common place for temporary files and logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem was due to the accumulation of large Docker image layers and unused containers over time, consuming all available disk space in the /var directory. This led to insufficient free space resulting in errors like \"No space left on device.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "- Clean up Docker images that are no longer used by the running containers:\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "sudo docker image prune -a\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Run Cleanup Script to Free Up Space\n",
      "Execute a weekly maintenance script for cleaning up old files and directories.\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "# /var/lib/docker/image/\n",

      "sudo find /var/log/ -type f -name \"*.log\" -mtime +30 -delete\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Monitor Disk Usage Post-Solution Implementation\n",
      "After the cleanup and removals, monitor disk usage to ensure no files are re-accumulating quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "df -h\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Preventive Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent similar issues from recurring:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implement Disk Space Monitoring**: Set up monitoring scripts or alerts to notify the team if disk space falls below a certain threshold.\n",
      "2. **Regular Maintenance and Cleanup Scripting**: Schedule weekly maintenance tasks to regularly clean up old files, images, and containers.\n",
      "3. **Optimize Docker Image Size**: Reduce image layers by using multi-stage builds in Dockerfiles, limiting unnecessary dependencies, and optimizing code.\n",
      "4. **Review CI/CD Pipeline Log Analysis**: Ensure logs are properly analyzed for potential issues that could lead to resource consumption.\n",
      "\n",

      " # Application Downtime Caused by Log Partition Overflow\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issue Summary\n",
      "Users reported an application downtime incident that lasted for approximately 20 minutes. This event was caused by the inability to write log entries due to a log partition reaching 100% utilization, which led to service crash loops.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "During the time of the downtime, users experienced application unavailability, preventing them from accessing services and receiving expected responses. Upon investigation, it became clear that all attempts at logging exceeded the configured storage capacity for logs within one of the log partitions in use by the production environment. This resulted in a continuous service failure loop as there was no mechanism to write additional logs due to the full partition.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
      "The root cause analysis indicates that excessive verbose debug logging, which had been enabled in the production environment, was not properly managed (specifically, without a rotation policy). As a result, the log partitions did not clear old entries appropriately and continued to fill until they were full. The failure loops occurred as there was no space available for new logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Troubleshooting & Resolution Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify Verbose Debug Logging**: First, identify which application or services are utilizing verbose debug logging in production mode.\n",
      "2. **Disable Verbose Debug Logging**: Once the affected applications are identified, disable verbose debug logging to prevent similar issues from recurring. This can be done by modifying configuration files for these applications and restarting them if necessary.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- [Configuration Modification] Check logs directories of the application servers and identify which ones have reached 100% capacity utilization.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- [Disable Logging]: Disable or reduce the verbosity level of debug logging, typically accomplished through application-specific configuration settings.\n",
      "3. **Clear Historical Logs**: To mitigate potential issues caused by historical full partitions, clear any data within those log partitions that is no longer needed.\n",
      "4. **Implement Centralized Logging with Retention Policy and Monitoring Alerts**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- [Centralize Log Management]: Integrate centralized logging infrastructure to manage logs more effectively, enabling better monitoring and management of log sizes across the system.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- [Retention Policy] Set a retention policy for logs that ensures old or outdated entries are automatically removed after a set period, preventing full partitions in the future.\n",
      "   \n",
      "- [Monitoring Alerts]: Establish alerts based on thresholds (e.g., 80% capacity utilization) to notify IT teams proactively when log partitions approach their limits, allowing timely intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Preventive Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Logging Best Practices**: Develop and enforce logging best practices that include:\n",
      "    \n",
      "- Regularly review application logs to ensure they are configured appropriately for production environments.\n",
      "    \n",
      "- Implement rotation policies to manage log file sizes efficiently.\n",
      "    \n",
      "- Use different log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING) based on the severity of information being logged.\n",
      "2. **Automated Alerts and Monitoring**: Configure automated alerts and monitoring systems that track log partition utilization. This will help in detecting issues early before they cause downtime.\n",
      "3. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of logging configurations and practices to ensure that all applications are configured correctly for production environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing the above steps, we can prevent similar incidents from occurring by ensuring that our logs remain manageable and do not overwhelm any partition within our log management system.\n",

      "To prevent this issue from recurring, consider the following preventive measures:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regularly Review and Adjust Retention Policies**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Regularly review and ensure that retention policies are correctly configured to avoid accumulation of unnecessary logs.\n",
      "2. **Implement Automated Backups and Restore Scripts**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Automate backup processes using scripts that include clean-up steps for old backups to prevent unarchived log file growth.\n",
      "3. **Enhance Monitoring and Alerting Mechanisms**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Enhance monitoring systems by setting up alerts on disk usage, backup completion status, and retention policy adherence.\n",
      "\n",
      "By adhering to these measures, the database environment can be maintained in a healthy state with minimized risk of future storage exhaustion issues.\n",

      " # Server Performance Degradation Due to Full Temp Directory\n",
      "\n",
      "## Issue Summary\n",
      "Server response time has significantly increased, primarily due to the `/tmp` directory becoming full with temporary export files generated by a reporting service. These files are preventing new file writes and interrupting system processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Description\n",
      "Upon investigation, it was found that `/tmp` had filled up to 90% of its capacity, resulting in a noticeable slowdown in server performance. Specifically, the increase in response time is attributed to these temporary files blocking new writes to the directory. The lack of periodic cleanup for these export files has led to their accumulation over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Root Cause Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Insufficient Cleanup Mechanism**: The reporting service generates numerous temporary files during its execution but does not automatically clean up these files after they are no longer needed.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  \n",
      "- These uncleaned files accumulate, causing `/tmp` to fill beyond its configured threshold.\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "- **File Write Blockages**: Due to the high volume of export files in `/tmp`, new file writes become blocked. This significantly affects system processes relying on file operations within this directory.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Troubleshooting & Resolution Steps\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Identify and Remove Stale Temporary Files**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Identify all temporary files currently residing in `/tmp`.\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     find /tmp -type f \\( -name \"*.log\" -o -name \"*.xml\" \\) -mtime +2 -delete  # Adjust patterns as needed\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   \n",
      "- This command will remove files older than 2 days (adjust `+2` to suit your needs).\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Setup Cron Job for Daily Cleanup**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Set up a cron job that runs a script daily to clean `/tmp`.\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     echo \"find /tmp -type f \\( -name '*.log' -o -name '*.xml' \\) -mtime +1 -delete\" | sudo tee /etc/cron.daily/tmp_cleanup.sh > /dev/null\n",
      "     chmod 755 /etc/cron.daily/tmp_cleanup.sh\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Update Reporting Service to Auto-Delete Files**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Ensure that the reporting service is configured with a mechanism to automatically delete temporary files after their intended use.\n",
      "     ```bash\n",
      "     # Example: Modify script that generates temporary files to include cleanup logic\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "## Preventive Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Regular Monitoring of `/tmp` Directory Size**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Implement monitoring scripts or tools like `df -h /tmp` in a scheduled manner (e.g., via cron jobs) to alert when the `/tmp` directory exceeds 80% capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Scheduled Cleanup Scripts**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Create and schedule cleanup scripts as part of regular maintenance tasks, particularly for directories that accumulate unnecessary files.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Service Behavior Modification**:\n",
      "   \n",
      "- Enhance the reporting service codebase with logic to clean up temporary files automatically post-use, ensuring they are removed promptly after their initial creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these steps, you can effectively mitigate future occurrences and maintain optimal performance of your servers.\n",
